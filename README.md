# Gym-Churn-Prediction
This project involves two main topics.

Segmentation and Labeling of Customers Based on Churn Risk: This involves dividing gym members into distinct groups and labeling them according to their likelihood of discontinuing their membership. Such segmentation is based on analyzing membership data to identify patterns and factors that contribute to customer attrition. By identifying high-risk customers, gyms can proactively implement targeted intervention strategies. These strategies could include personalized fitness plans, special offers, or additional support, all aimed at enhancing customer retention.

Development of a Predictive Model for Churn Status: The second goal is to create a predictive model that can forecast the churn status of individual gym members. This model would use various variables and membership data, such as frequency of gym visits, duration of membership, engagement with gym services, and possibly personal demographics. By inputting this data into the model, gym owners and managers can predict which members are more likely to cancel their memberships. This predictive insight allows for more efficient and effective retention efforts, as interventions can be specifically tailored to those members most at risk of leaving.

Overall, the prediction of gym churn rates is a strategic approach to maintaining a stable and engaged customer base. It leverages data analytics to enhance the understanding of customer behavior, enabling gyms to take proactive steps to improve member satisfaction and reduce turnover.
